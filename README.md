# LittleManComputer
An LMC interpreter (and compiler), with example programs

the example program.txt is a divide/remainder program

run the runprogram.py file to run the program

ideally, open in VSCode, set the .vscode/launch.json file to the launch.json given here to automatically run the runprogram.py file whatever file you are currently viewing.
That means you can edit the LMC code in program.txt, then hit F5 and see it run in the terminal. Nice!
